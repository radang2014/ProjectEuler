# ProjectEuler
Contains solutions to selected Project Euler problems. These solutions are meant to showcase one method of solving the problem. As per Project Euler's rules, there will be no solutions to problems above 100.

Compile the .cpp file containing code for a specific problem and run the main() function. In Terminal, the commands for doing so are (let X be the problem number):
g++ -g -o problemX -Wall -Wextra problemX.cpp

./problemX
