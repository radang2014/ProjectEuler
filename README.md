# ProjectEuler
Contains solutions to selected Project Euler problems. These solutions are meant to showcase one method of solving the problem. As per Project Euler's rules, there will be no solutions to problems above 100.

For solutions with a C++ source, compile the `.cpp` file containing code for a specific problem and run the resulting executable. With `g++` and a Linux based system, the commands for compiling and running are (let X be the problem number):
* `g++ -g -o problemX -Wall -Wextra problemX.cpp`
* `./problemX`

For solutions with a Java source, from the directory containing the Java source, compile and run with:
* javac *.java
* java Main
